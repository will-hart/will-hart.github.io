demarcate.js is a new open source project to create an in-line or in-place
markdown editor. This allows you to edit an HTML page by clicking on elements
and typing in a box that appears in their place.

The contents of the page can then be retrieved in Markdown encoded text which
can be saved to a database to persist changes.

demarcate.js was designed to become the main editor for `textr`, an online
publishing service. You can see the source and browse some more demos at the
github page: https://github.com/will-hart/demarcate.js.
