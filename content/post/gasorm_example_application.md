I've recently been using [GasORM](https://github.com/toopay/gas-orm) which is a
very neat little Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for CodeIgniter 2.0+. I
wanted to help out a little bit with this great library so I have written a
little tutorial

This example application is now included as part of the Gas ORM documentation.
It can be found at
[http://gasorm-doc.taufanaditya.com/example.html](http://gasorm-doc.taufanaditya.com/example.html).
If you are looking for a very simple, efficient and lightweight library for
database interaction then check out GasORM.
