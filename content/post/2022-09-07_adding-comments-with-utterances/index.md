I don't really know if anybody looks at this blog or finds it useful. There does
seem to be a bit of traffic, and maybe people want to talk about some of the
posts, I dunno.

Previouly I used `disqus` but it feels a bit heavyweight. So I'm trialling
<https://utteranc.es/>, which uses github issues for comments. I have no idea if
anybody will write anything, but I assume the people coming here will have a
github account. Let's see what happens I guess?
