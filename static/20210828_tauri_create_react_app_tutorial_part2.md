## Recap

In [part 1](/20210826_tauri_create_react_app_tutorial_part1) of this tutorial series we set up a Tauri and create-react-app app and added a basic non-functional counter. In [part 2](/20210828_tauri_create_react_app_tutorial_part2) we created and invoked a command for incrementing our counter.

In this part, we will write a generic hook for invoking and updating hook data. In theory this hook could be reused for both web APIs or invoked commands by changing the underlying `fetcher` used by `swr`.
