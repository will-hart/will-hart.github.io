<article class="container col mblg"><p>Iâ€™ve recently gone back to uni to get an engineering degree. Its hard workâ€¦
many hours of study, constantly learning new things and challenging my brain in
a way that it hasnâ€™t been challenged for nearly a decade. One of the
difficulties Iâ€™ve had is keeping track of all the assignments that are due, the
class tests, the lab reports, and so on. So I decided to put together an
assessment tracking tool me and my fellow students could use.</p>
<p>Initially I built a spreadsheet but that didnâ€™t quite cut it. First of all it
was a bit ugly, and secondly it was a pain to keep track of all the classes and
to work out what was due when. So I set about building a little web application
to help me manage my coursework - to keep track of my progress and my scores, to
work out how much of a subject I had completed, and to remind me when something
was due soon. What resulted was GradeKeep!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>The idea behind GradeKeep is pretty simple. Its an Open Source, online web
application for teachers and students. Its for tracking your progress and
keeping you informed when due dates are approaching.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>List all of your subjects and coursework/assignments</li>
<li>Work out when things are due</li>
<li>Keep track of your scores</li>
<li>Keep track of your progress</li>
<li>Get notified when something is due</li>
<li>Share or install template courses with all your subjects/coursework already
defined</li>
</ol>
<p>GradeKeep is free and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.github.com/mecharius/GradeManager">open source</a> so you are welcome to use it on your own server, modify, fork, make pull requests and so on if you are a Github ninja.</p>
