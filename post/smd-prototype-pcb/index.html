<article class="container col mblg"><p>I frequently come up with ideas for projects. If I really like the idea, I draw
up the schematic and then maybe breadboard it. If I think the idea might be
useful I normally try to make something a bit more permanent. This is fine for
through hole devices - a slab of vero board, a couple of components from my
through hole collection and away we go, however it is not so great for SMD
circuits. I decided I needed to build and SMD prototype board.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been enticed into trying out SMD designs, partly because there is a better
range of components, partly because the designs are smaller and mostly because
it‚Äôs a new challenge. SMD designs are all well and good, but they makes bread
boarding extremely difficult and more or less require a custom PCB every time
you want to mock up a design. I could make the boards myself, but as I‚Äôm
studying full time I don‚Äôt have all the time in the world so the decision is
normally to try and buy one. What tends to happen then is I do the sums and
realise that I don‚Äôt really need to spend 40 quid to make some transistor logic
gates, and the project gets filed away.</p>
<p>A few days ago it hit me‚Ä¶ the thing that‚Äôs missing in my life is an SMD
prototype PCB, basically an ‚ÄúSMD breadboard‚Äù. After some ebay searching and a
bit of head scratching I realised that there wasn‚Äôt much out there that I would
actually like to pay for. So I decided to design one myself.</p>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was sit down and try to work out what I wanted from the PCB. The basic idea is to build an SMD Prototype PCB that can be used flexibly either as a breadboard / breakout, or as a PCB in its own right. SMD parts can be soldered to it and prototype circuits built. The eventual design concept I came up with was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Breadboard compatible</li>
<li>Footprints for several SOIC 300 chips</li>
<li>Prototyping area for through hole components</li>
<li>ICSP and XTAL connectors for one of the SOIC footprints</li>
<li>A place for one 0805 chip on each SOIC pin</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-design">The Design</h2>
<p>With the specification on board, I set about routing the board. I started using
a Schematic and converting this into a PCB, but in the end ditched the schematic
and just worked on the PCB manually. The Rev A design I came up with is shown
below:</p>
<p><img src="https://willhart.io/post/smd-prototype-pcb/smd_proto_board_1.png" alt="SMD Prototype Board" /></p>
<p>I decided to use the 0805 footprints on each SOIC pin as a solder jumper if no
component is required. In practice, this requires either a 0 ohm resistor on the
pad, or a bit of wire as a solder jumper. I also pulled the solder mask back on
the through hole area to match the approach of a copper clad vero board.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to solder your components on the footprint and then hookup
with jumper wire where its needed. I‚Äôve tried to find a balance in the design
between pre wired connections and flexibility.</p>
<p><img src="https://willhart.io/post/smd-prototype-pcb/soic_dev_breadboard.jpg" alt="SMD Prototype Board" /></p>
<p>The image above shows the board with a PIC 28 pin device and a 24 pin 16 channel
LED driver. There is a slight misalignment between the two SOIC sections meaning
it takes a second or two to push it into the breadboard. I‚Äôm about to wire this
one up to control the LED matrix via the LED driver.</p>
