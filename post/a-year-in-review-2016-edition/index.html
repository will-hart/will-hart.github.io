<article class="container col mblg"><p>Looking back, 2016 was a fairly big year for me. I travelled a bit, finished up
some major work projects, moved house (to a different hemisphere) and started a
PhD! I thought it might be nice to look back at the year in review for my
favourite hobby - game dev.</p>
<h2 id="game-jams">Game Jams</h2>
<p>I try to do game jams when I can, as its a great way to test out ideas.
Obviously juggling family life and game jams can be a bit of a challenge, but I
still managed to release five games for Game Jams in 2016!</p>
<h3 id="twirlygig">Twirlygig</h3>
<p><img src="https://willhart.io/post/a-year-in-review-2016-edition/twirlygig.jpg" alt="A terrible game jam game (size: 551x500px)" /></p>
<p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127063404/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&amp;uid=50407">Ludum Dare 35 Link</a></p>
<p>This game was an example of what happens when you try to balance family life
with a weekend game jam! To follow on from the Button Simulator, I decided to
make another game using ReactJS. The theme of the jam was ‚Äúshape shifting‚Äù and I
wanted to see if I could use React to simulate physics. Basically the idea is
there are a whole lot of shapes which swirl down towards the centre, and you
have to press keys to match the shapes before they hit the centre. Its
not (quite) the worst game I ever made.</p>
<h3 id="clockwork-dragon">Clockwork Dragon</h3>
<p><img src="https://willhart.io/post/a-year-in-review-2016-edition/clockwork-dragon.jpg" alt="Clockwork Dragon - a game I was actually proud of (size: 731x500px)" /></p>
<p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wilsk.itch.io/clockwork-dragon">Ludum Dare 36 Link</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm actually fairly proud of this game - I think its probably one of the best
games I‚Äôve released to date. In this voxel adventure, you are a steam powered
dragon that flies around scaring villagers to steal their gold. Use the gold to
upgrade yourself, and follow along with the story.</p>
<h3 id="missile-commander">Missile Commander</h3>
<p><img src="https://willhart.io/post/a-year-in-review-2016-edition/missile-commander.png" alt="Missile Commander - a game made in about three hours (size: 596x402px)" /></p>
<p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wilsk.itch.io/missile-commander">Game Dev League Artificial Intelligence Jam, itch.io link</a></p>
<p>I wasn‚Äôt going to take part in this game jam, but changed my mind at the last
minute. Hence this game was made in about 2-3 hours, and it shows! Its kind of a
cross between <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://interplanetary.weebly.com/">Interplanetary</a> and just about
any artillery type game ever made. Fire off missiles from the surface of the
earth and hope to get the enemy before they get you.</p>
<h3 id="the-eridanus-monument">The Eridanus Monument</h3>
<p><img src="https://willhart.io/post/a-year-in-review-2016-edition/eridanus-monument.png" alt="Eridanus Monument - my attempt at a more narrative game (size: 473x312px)" /></p>
<p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wilsk.itch.io/eridanus">Game Dev League Area 51 Jam, itch.io link</a></p>
<p>This was probably the most experimental ‚Äúgame‚Äù I‚Äôve made to date. Its a
hand-drawn story driven narrative game. There isn‚Äôt a whole lot of game play, so
I guess its almost semi-interactive fiction. I‚Äôm pretty proud of it, even if the
‚Äúcritical reception‚Äù wasn‚Äôt great.</p>
<h3 id="github-game-jam-november">GitHub Game Jam (November)</h3>
<p>I also participated in the GitHub November Game Jam, and along with Zentropy
built up a functioning RTS, and a solid entity component system framework which
I hope I‚Äôll have more to say about later.</p>
<h2 id="art">‚ÄúArt‚Äù</h2>
<p>I tinkered around quite a lot with Blender and MagicaVoxel in 2016, mostly in
the low poly style because thats about all I can manage. Here are a few things I
worked on.</p>

<h2 id="2017">2017?</h2>
<p>Well I‚Äôm pretty excited for 2017 both professionally and for game dev. I‚Äôm
working with Zentropy from the GitHub game jam on some new ideas and our ECS is
maturing rapidly. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll have a lot more to talk about this year, and
this time in 2018 :)</p>
