# willhart.io Website

This is the source (NextJS) for my blog at [willhart.io](https://willhart.io).

## Adding a post

1. Add the URL to `static/posts.ts` at the bottom of the list
2. Create a markdown file in `/static/` with `-` replaced by `_` and an `.md` extension
3. See other posts for image path conventions and YAML frontmatter requirements
4. `git commit` and `git push`
5. Deployment is automatic
